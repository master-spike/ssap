1.  Each participant 1..N generates a temporary private/public key-pair for the
    secret santa allocation, and a secret number.

2.  Participant N generates another key-pair and broadcasts the public key to
    each other participant. Each participant broadcasts the sha-256 hash of
    their secret number.

3.  Starting from participant 1, participants n : (1..N-1) generates a message
    M encrypting their own public key with N's public key, passing the message
    to the next participant. The next participant appends their own encrypted
    public key to the message, and shuffles the public keys before passing it
    to the next participant.

4.  When participant N receives the message M, they decrypt each key in the
    list, append their own unencrypted public key, then reshuffle it.

5.  Participant N broadcasts the decryped anonymized list to each participant,
    and each participant broadcasts their secret number, which the other
    participants can verify wasn't changed by comparing the sha-256.

6.  The participants xor all the initially-secret numbers together to produce
    the seed for a deterministic pseudorandom permutaton generator, and permute
    the list according to the generated random permutaton. The result is a
    tamper-proof, anonymized randomly-ordered list of everyone's SSK public
    keys which we will call L.

7.  Each participant looks at the permuted list L and identifies their giver
    key G as the public key that appears after their own in the list. Each
    participant broadcasts their signed identity encrypted with G.

8.  Each participant then looks at their receipts and attempts to decrypt each
    receipt with their SSK private key. On success, they receive their target,
    and verify their signature.
